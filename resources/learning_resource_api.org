* How to use various learning resources apis
** khanacademy.org
Their api does not require any keys. Just flat request to url
http://www.khanacademy.org/api/v1/topictree?kind=topic
This will send the entire topic tree from khanacademy site
*** Pull in the data to our database
The data is topic driven from *root*. All the topics from root have children
The key points to look for are *translated_standalone_title* which give the actual topic course name and *domain_slug* which gives the parent topic

I think this is all we need to do what we want at this time.

** edx.org
